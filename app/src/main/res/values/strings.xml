    <string name="Q1"><b>Q: Do you store our information?</b>\nA:Nope, we don\'t need to. We simply compare your input against the HIBP database.</string>
    <string name="Q2"><b>Q: What should I do if my password is compromised?</b>\nA:Change your password immediately. Make sure it contains Upper and Lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
        Remember to rotate your passwords and to not use similar ones across too many platforms and too often.</string>
    <string name="Q3"><b>Q: What can I do about being breached or compromised?</b>\nA: The best thing you can do is to research the incident. You want to know how and why your email or other credential
        was involved in a breach. Additionally, you want to see if there exist any lawsuits; you may eligible for compensation.</string>
    <string name="Q4"><b>Q: Are there tools I can use to better help me protect my information?</b>\nA: Absolutely! We recommend password vaults or some tool that allows you to generate a unique
        password for each login like mobilePass or Google Authenticator. The vaults allow you to remember one password to sign into the vault and the vault contains random password for
        the sites you access regularly. The caveat being, a hacker knowing that single password now has access to your other passwords. Prevent this by using two factor or multi factor
        authentication.</string>
