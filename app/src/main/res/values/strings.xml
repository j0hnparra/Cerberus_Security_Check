    <string name="title_activity_faq">FAQs</string>
    <string name="faq_body">Frequently Asked Questions</string>

    <string name="Q1"><b>Q: Do you store our information?</b>\nA: Nope, we don\'t need to. We simply compare your input against the HIBP database.</string>
    <string name="Q2"><b>Q: What should I do if my password is compromised?</b>\nA: Change your password immediately. Make sure it contains Upper and Lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
        Remember to rotate your passwords and to not use similar ones across too many platforms and too often.</string>
    <string name="Q3"><b>Q: What can I do about being breached or compromised?</b>\nA: The best thing you can do is to research the incident. You want to know how and why your email or other credential
        was involved in a breach. Additionally, you want to see if there exist any lawsuits; you may eligible for compensation.</string>
    <string name="Q4"><b>Q: Are there tools I can use to better help me protect my information?</b>\nA: Absolutely! We recommend password vaults or some tool that allows you to generate a unique
        password for each login like mobilePass or Google Authenticator. The vaults allow you to remember one password to sign into the vault and the vault contains random password for
        the sites you access regularly. The caveat being, a hacker knowing that single password now has access to your other passwords. Prevent this by using two factor or multi factor
        authentication.</string>

        - Website Visitors
         \n
        Like most website operators, Cerberus Security Check collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
        browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cerberus Security Check\'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how Cerberus Security Check\'s visitors use its website. From time to time, Cerberus Security Check may release non-personally-identifying
        information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        \n
        Cerberus Security Check also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on

        discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
        \n
        - Gathering of Personally-Identifying
        \n
        Certain visitors to Cerberus Security Check\'s websites choose to interact with Cerberus Security Check in ways that require Cerberus Security Check to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cerberus Security Check gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example,
        we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at CerberusSecurityCheck@gmail.com to provide a username and email address.
