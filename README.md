# Cerberus Security Check

Cerberus Security Check is an Android application that allows users to check whether their email or username has ever been compromised in a data breach.
* If the email or username is found to be at risk, the user will be informed of the origin, method, and significance.
* The data obtained in this application was obtained via the use of an Application programming interface (API) key via haveibeenpwned.com.


Example: Bob enters his email address "bob@gmail.com" and discovers his email address has been affected by several data breaches in the past.
